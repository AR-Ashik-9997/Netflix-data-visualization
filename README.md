summary: "Excited to share my latest data science project where I explored Netflix's content trends using a Kaggle dataset!"

## Overview

This project helped me sharpen my data wrangling and visualization skills while uncovering some cool insights about Netflix’s strategy.

### Key Features
- Performed full exploratory data analysis (EDA) on **8,800+** Netflix titles from a real Kaggle dataset  
- Cleaned messy real-world data: nested columns, inconsistent dates, duplicates, and high missing-value rates  
- Built publication-quality visualizations (line plots, stacked area charts, multi-subplot dashboards)  
- Revealed Netflix’s major strategic pivot from movies to TV shows (~2015–2020) + rise of international content  
- Fully reproducible & well-documented Google Colab notebook with rich markdown explanations  

### Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas (data wrangling & feature engineering)  
- Matplotlib + Seaborn (visualizations)  
- NumPy  
- Google Colab (interactive, shareable environment)  

### Challenges & Learnings
- **Messy nested data** → Mastered `explode()`, custom date parsing, and safe handling of missing values in Pandas  
- **Choosing the right chart** → Learned the strengths of stacked area charts vs. line plots vs. subplots; perfected color usage, annotations, and scaling  
- **Explaining technical work on LinkedIn** → Honed storytelling: turned raw trends into simple, powerful insights that non-technical people instantly understood  
- Big takeaway: Data science = question → ruthless cleaning → clear visualization → compelling story  

### Outcome & Impact
- **15,000+ impressions** and **500+ likes** on LinkedIn in the first week (my most engaged post ever)  
- Direct messages from recruiters praising the clean code and storytelling  
- Added a strong, real-world portfolio piece showcasing end-to-end EDA skills  
- Significantly leveled up confidence and speed with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn  
- Reinforced that great projects + great presentation = massive visibility
